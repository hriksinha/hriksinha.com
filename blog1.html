                DailyJS is one of the best JavaScript blogs on the internet. The blog was started by Alex R. Young, an entrepreneur and Node.js expert in 2009. However, there are recent changes that don’t sound great. Currently, the blog is no longer updated, but that does not make the content useless at all.
                The blog covers diverse content on JavaScript including frameworks, API’s, libraries, etc.

                David Walsh is a renowned name in the JavaScript world.
                He started his career with DZone, but his first real break came while working for SitePen as a Software Engineer. His blog composes of topics related to JavaScript, personal thoughts, guides and much more. The blog design is captivating and is going to hook you up on the first visit. Currently, he is working as a Senior Web Developer at Mozilla.

                Robin works in Berlin. He writes a lot (and quite often) about React and friends. But also (and that’s what makes him interesting) he writes about stuff like AI and machine learning. There aren’t a lot of places where you can read articles like “A Web Developer’s Guide to Machine Learning in Javascript” or “Neural Networks in Javascript.” If you’re interested in those topics, you definitely need to follow Robin.

                I hope you liked this list. Now go ahead and add them to your preferred RSS reader as I did and enjoy the perpetual flow of the best articles from the JavaScript world!
